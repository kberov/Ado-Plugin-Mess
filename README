NAME
    Ado::Plugin::Vest - Messaging services for an Ado system!

DESCRIPTION
    Ado::Plugin::Vest implements a (not too) naive messaging service. It can
    be used as a chat between two users or as commenting widget under some
    article. Other uses are also possible. Just create your client (HTML5 or
    desktop) application and start making Ajax (or Websocket - TODO)
    requests. Currently a HTTP based chat application is being implemented
    as a proof of concept.

    Note that this distribution is fairly experimental and the author gladly
    accepts proposals enlightenment and inspiration.

SYNOPSIS
    1. To enable this plugin after installation, add it to etc/ado.conf
          #"plugins" section *after* DSC plugin.
          plugins => [
            #...
            'vest',
            #...
         ],

    2. Restart Ado
    3. Add users to the group 'vest' so they can use the application. See
    examples below. See also Ado::Command::adduser.
            # Add to group 'vest':
            berov@u165:~/opt/public_dev/Ado$ bin/ado adduser -u berov -g vest

            #Create a user and add it to group 'vest'
            berov@u165:~/opt/public_dev/Ado$ bin/ado adduser -u berov \
              -g vest -f Krasimir -l Berov -e berov@cpan.org -d 0 -p pa55w0r4
            User 'berov' was created with primary group 'berov'.
            User 'berov' was added to group 'vest'.

    4. Search for other users and add them as contacts. User interface is
    not yet implemented. You can add contacts for a user using the
    comandline:
            #add berov to test1's contacts
            berov@u165:~/opt/public_dev/Ado$ bin/ado adduser -u berov \
              -g vest_contacts_for_test1
            'berov' is already taken!
            User 'berov' was added to group 'vest_contacts_for_test1'.

            #add test1 to berov's contacts
            berov@u165:~/opt/public_dev/Ado$ bin/ado adduser -u test1 -g vest_contacts_for_berov
            'test1' is already taken!
            User 'test1' was added to group 'vest_contacts_for_berov'.

    5. Login as one of the added users: http://yourdomain/login
    6. Go to http://yourdomain/vest
    7. Have some chat...
