NAME
    Ado::Plugin::Vest - Messaging services for an Ado system!

DESCRIPTION
    Ado::Plugin::Vest implements a (not too) naive messaging service. It can
    be used as a chat between two users or as commenting widget under some
    article. Other uses are also possible. Just create your client (HTML5 or
    desktop) application and start making Ajax (or Websocket - TODO)
    requests. Currently a HTTP based chat application is being implemented
    as a proof of concept.

    Note that this distribution is fairly experimental and the author gladly
    accepts proposals enlightenment and inspiration.
