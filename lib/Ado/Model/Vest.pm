=head1 NAME

Ado::Model::Vest - A class for TABLE vest

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    #select messages from a talk
    my $messages =
      Ado::Model::Vest->by_subject_message_id(
        $user, $s_m_id, $limit, $offset)
    #list them
    foreach(@$messages){
    ..
    }
    # create a new message
    Ado::Model::Vest->create(%params, tstamp => time);

Look at L<Ado::Control::Vest> for a wealth of usage examples.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides methods for manipulating messages and talks.
It uses the table C<vest> as storage.
A message is a record in table C<vest>.
A talk consists of a set of messages, having the same value in column
L</subject_message_id> and one record which column L</id> has the same value.
In other words, the record which L</id> value is referenced by other records in
L</subject_message_id>, is the parent record, that defines a talk.
This is the first message in a talk.  

=head1 COLUMNS

Each column from table C<vest> has an accessor in this class.

=head2 id

The primary key for the message. C<INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT>.

=head2 from_uid

Id of the user who sends the message. C<INT(11) REFERENCES users(id) NOT NULL>.

=head2 to_uid

Id of the user to whom the message is sent. C<INT(11) REFERENCES users(id) DEFAULT 0>.
Can be zero (0) in case the message is sent to the whole group.
This way we can have group talks. 

In case both to_uid and to_guid values are zero,
the sender is talking to him self - Taking Notes. See L</to_guid>.

=head2 to_guid

Id of the group to which the message is sent. 
C<INT(11) REFERENCES groups(id) DEFAULT 0>.
In case the value is zero (0) the message is private. If it has C<to_uid!=0>,
the message can be seen by the user referenced by  C<to_uid>, otherwise only 
the user referenced by C<from_uid> can see the message. 

=head2 subject

Subject (topic) of the talk. C<VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT ''>. 
Only the first message in a talk has a subject.
Every next message has C<subject=''>.

=head2 subject_message_id

Id of the first message in a talk. The first message in a talk has
C<subject_message_id=0>. Eevery next message has C<subject_message_id> equal
to the C<id> of the first message. There can be many conversations in a
group or between two users.

=head2 tstamp

Last modification time. All dates are stored as seconds since the epoch(1970). 
In Perl we use a Time::Piece object to format this value as we wish.

=head2 message

The message it self. C<TEXT>.

=head2 message_assets

File-paths (relative to C<$app-E<gt>home>) of Files attached to this message - TODO.

=head2 permissions 

Can be used in case the message is published as status update and it should be
readable only by certain users.
C<VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL DEFAULT '-rw-r-----'>.

=head2 seen

Incremented by 1 by the client chat application when the message is displayed
on the screen of the user referred by C<to_uid> or by some member of
the group referred by C<to_guid>. C<INTEGER DEFAULT 0>. TODO.


=head1 METHODS

L<Ado::Model::Vest> inherits all methods from L<Ado::Model> and implements
the following new ones.

=head2 by_subject_message_id

Selects messages from a talk within a given range, ordered by talk id descending
and returns an ARRAY reference of HASHES.
Only messages that are viewable by the current user are selected

    my $messages = Ado::Model::Vest->by_subject_message_id(
        $c->user, $subject_message_id, $limit, $offset
    );

=head2 count_messages

Counts messages in a talk for a user by given subject_message_id
Returns an integer.

my $count = Ado::Model::Vest->count_messages($user, $s_m_id);

=head2 create

Creates a new message. Performs a check If there is a talk with C<id> equal to
the  C<subject_message_id> of the message or if the subject of the message is
equal to a talk subject. Depending on the results either creates a new talk or
a new message within a talk. In case the message is part of an existing talk the
C<subject> is set to '';
Returns C<$self>.

=head2 talks

Selects records which contain talk subjects(topics) (C<subject!=''>)
from all messages within a given range, ordered by talk id descending
and returns an ARRAYref of HASHES.
Only messages that are viewable by the current user are selected.

    my $messages = Ado::Model::Vest->talks($c->user, $limit, $offset);

=head1 GENERATOR

This class was initially generated using L<DBIx::Simple::Class::Schema> and later
edited and enriched by the author.
